The bulk of our day was spent learning Methods, Arrays and Objects in Javascript. I found today to be
very interesting, because the various types of Methods in Javascript have intrigued me since I had been
initially exposed to them while exploring Javascript. Methods are actions that can be performed on 
objects, but they are essentially just functions with more specific purposes... And there are tons of 
them, and more to be discovered. Some of the ones that we discussed were .toString which will turn your
data into a string, .concat which will combine multiple arrays or objects into one string or one 
array, and .splice, which was very helpful while I was working on my Lab 7 project today. Splice
allows you to add or remove any element of your array. As I said, there are a whole lot of Methods 
and these ones are barely the tip of the iceberg.
	We also went over Arrays and Objects today, which I really enjoyed learning about as well. 
Objects are structures that allow us to store collections of data, and they are everywhere in Javascript.
Though we were just learning the basics of them, Objects are excellent when used to bundle data together
for very complex programs, and Objects use curly brackets, which you add your values or properties to,
they are also seperated by commas. 
	Arrays are basically just Objects with different types of attributes. They are data structures
with a collection elements, or to explain more simply, they are like a list with a bunch of items on
it. When you create an array, you do so by adding square brackets. Arrays are identified by a 
Numerical Index, so when creating Arrays, it is important to remember that computers start counting at 
0 instead of 1, so the first number that you count will be 0.
